    - Ask the search agent to search and download youtube transcripts.  It will return a file name with the downloads and the transcripts can be found in the 'transcripts' column
    - Create a task for the llm agent, which can analyze the transcripts and store the output in the same file as a new column. It will return the column name.
    - Create a child task for the display_dataframe agent, which can display the dataframe with the new column
