  template: |
    The planner should find out what research the user wants to do.  Once you do that, create the following tasks
    - Ask the search agent to search and download youtube transcripts.  It will return a file name with the downloads and the transcripts can be found in the 'transcripts' column
    - Create a task for the llm agent, which can analyze the transcripts and store the output in the same file as a new column.
