a few quick tips and tricks with Xero and things that you can do to import' and to improve your importing and improve your property business overall so now you should make the same items for 320 example n0 this is just a standard profit and loss that we normally look at so if you go to reports from further loss and then under the common format you should both to look and you just under the normal current previous three months you can see what the renters and for the previous few months you can see the expenses immense so this might show you that you've had insurance you've had insurance and now you're missing insurance for some reason so gives you some good information you can pick out busing things it also gives you overall profit or loss which is obviously really important business and really important for you as a rental property owner there's a few more things you can doing just little tips and tricks that hopefully you're doing so the real basic one is when you got items to reconcile click on reconcile if you go to cash coding ideally you want as many items as possible to be memorized so we're getting reach them from qrm this is all in memorizing it so that it's coming up under into income the same when you've got rates going out when you've got interest going out you want them all to be memorized and you want them to have them for a property so all we need to do when we're going to code it was code most of the April results is just save and reconcile and we're all done this is actually no coding because I've memorized the items [Music] if you haven't got tracking setup if you go to settings in general there's tracking so you can put on your different properties so for example we might rename that rather than pop new one it might be history [Music] you can put a category name so we'll hear properties and the different caterer is a different streets and you can add more and to either one of those if you go into the Budget Manager so reports and then Budget Manager you can see some the overall budget for what you might want to do so you might be wanting to get in three thousand dollars a month you might be going wanting to get in the three thousand dollars off print you click the green arrow and you can then copy it the whole way across so each month has it all the way across just saves you a lot of time and hassle we could put in the air insurance that we're expecting it to be $300 and just on our loans might be true and a half thousand we might be looking at having five hundred dollars of repairs and our rates might be two hundred dollars and yeah copy all of those across you can save it you can view it you can export it to excel and so there's lots of different things that you can do with it the main one that I would then do from here is budget variance reports you don't have budget variance coming up you click call reports and then you can choose which one the three arrows give you more options so I've clicked on the star next a budget variance so that you get budget variance report when you click on them to start with it gives you some basic information so overall we've received four thousand two hundred agree but it was three thousand without twelve hundred fantastic so what you're looking at is the actual budget and bits and then year-to-date actual budget and variance because we're an April they're the same figures but you can look at things as well under a mortgage it actually a lot higher you can then look into why so you can click onto any of these items a step further and if you're getting into your rental properties you've got more as if you click on compare periods and rather than overall budget once if we just look at property one and we change the data as well to B to B Street updates then what we're doing is we're just computing this property 1 or B Street so we've got the rent from that we've got the budget from that we can see what the variances we could do the same with our property number 2 we could change to that and again we're just looking at that property then and comparing its actual budget and variance so yeah that's all I've got to show you so few critical things one is make sure you memorize or create rules to see that you're coding see not having to code a whole lot look regularly at your profit and loss it shows you some great information and set up simple budgets under the budget manager so you can do budget variance reports and then look at your actual budget and Barents and other compare periods you look more detail so you're actually looking at just one particular property hopefully it's going to be some great information and make sure you like our Facebook page we've got a whole lot more videos and good information coming up and we also post a lot of information it's all about property it's all free to you it's not a sales pitch it's great information and we've also got some monthly accounting fees that we're just working on at the moment looking at making it more efficient by you being on 0 during the coding through they're using the memorization figures and then us giving you a monthly figure they're slightly discounted because it's more efficient thank you very much", "comments": "Is Xero useful for property managers\nHi Ross, great video.

awesome reports so that you can see what your profit or loss is you can see you put a budget Erlin compared to budget and number three you can actually attach your PDFs so save him to keep files and files of information and you can actually find it again by just double-clicking also clicking on the information and my last one is it's actually it's actually cheaper for you to do through zero so yeah we actually do your accounts cheaper and easier if your your on zero because it saves us time and his for so that's another great reason to go and zero if you are looking at putting your into accounts on the zero give us a quick email Ross at CES why Coco tightens it and we can help you organize it and yeah we generally put you on a monthly fee and we're we set up for you we do the memorization and things and the fee includes a monthly fee includes a zero subscription as well so there's no extra cost to you thank you very much and I hope for you really enjoy a niche is", "comments": "Thanks,  I am an aspiring Real Estate Bookkeeper from the Philippines, learning XERO Australia, and hopefully getting a client from Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\nThank u\nWow but I'm a tech dunse\nHi Ross, great Xero videos thank you.

"video_id": "xADpHXK-iOA", "transcript": "QuickBooks versus zero what's the best accounting software for your rental portfolio here's the answer it's zero zero allows you to do class tracking and category tracking on its first tier plan Quickbooks on the other hand reserves that for its third tier plan so you can get what you need to get done in zero for a fraction of the cost that's it you can quit watching the video now or hang tight and real quick if you're thinking QuickBooks has been around forever my CPA uses it it's the gold standard everything else is just a watered-down version of it and it's going to be a pain to switch don't worry I have those exact same thoughts and I go through them in this video so hang tight and watch it till the end before I talk about xero I didn't want to address one question because there are a lot of different accounting softwares out there that you can use and why am I narrowing it down to QuickBooks and zero so I have a list of about seven things that I think every rental uh investor should care about when they're talking about an accounting software number one the software needs to be robust and something that can grow with you because obviously you could use something like a spreadsheet or there's a lot of simple options but once you get into more complicated things those ones easily become not a good solution number two cloud-based so you know a lot of people say just use QuickBooks desktop in 2023 um you probably could have said this five years ago but uh you need something that's cloud-based for lots of reasons it's going to make your life much easier for dealing with your CPA much easier for dealing with somebody else if you ever want to not be the person doing the actual accounting and the list goes on with backing up stuff so cloud-based is key number three uh double entry accounting uh that is a simple term just to say that the software meets the industry standard Double Entry accounting means for every uh thing you have you have One debit and one credit it just allows for checks and balances it reduces errors in your work uh stessa is a great software but unfortunately that's one thing that software doesn't have creative financing that's another thing so if you're ever going to do private money loans or hard money loans or portfolio loans and you want to be able to track those into your accounting software the interest some softwares don't allow you to do that and um you know a good example again unfortunately is Tessa it's something I know they're working on but again one of those things that you might not have to worry about it now but if you want a software that can grow with you the ability to do accrual accounting so there's cash accounting and accrual accounting and they're just two different types of accounting most people will be doing things on a cash basis but there are some instances depending on how you run your business that you might need to do a cruel accounting and some softwares uh don't allow you to do that at all so affordability is something I talked about between xero and QuickBooks but in general that ruled out a lot of different software so Sage 50 is another popular software and you know that's one that unfortunately for a smaller landlord if you only have like 10 units or so it might not make sense to pay that much for an accounting software also a lot of the property management tools like buildium and AppFolio have built-in Property Management tools as well excuse me built-in accounting tools but again it might not make sense you know to pay all that for a software all right and lastly class and category tracking that allows you to track your expenses per property which you need to do to file your taxes and again not all softwares do that uh freshbooks again is a great software I heard a lot of good things about it but it has limitations in there those are the reasons why I ruled out a lot of softwares I know a lot of people use uh and why I zeroed it down zeroed zeroed it down to QuickBooks and zero those are both robust softwares they allow you to do everything you need to do for accounting they can grow with you they do double entry accounting they allow for complex accounting uh they can do accrual accounting they can just do everything I know the first question I had when somebody first brought up zero to me is how come I've never heard of it and that's a good question uh the short answer is it's actually based out of New Zealand but once you leave the US and you look at an international market zero is wildly popular as far as a backstory about both companies QuickBooks has been around since the early 80s uh and zero has been around since uh early 2000s QuickBooks was only a desktop version until again the early 2000s when QuickBooks Online started one cool thing about xero it has actually been an online platform from the start so it only has one product versus QuickBooks has a couple products they're trying to put together for a quick reference as of this recording QuickBooks Online has about 5 million users QuickBooks desktop has about 3 million users and zero has about 3.5 million users and that's all worldwide this is actually a pretty powerful visual as well you know again they started in 2006 and they were a nobody and and this is 2010 and you know as we're going over to 2022 you know 3.5 million users so they have had wild growth and what I anticipate is this is going to just get more and more popular as people discover it here in the United States let's take a quick deeper dive here this is a study that was done in 2020 looking at accounting platforms by region so if we go down here and we see the United States lower left here you can see QuickBooks is the clear winner uh QuickBooks Online self-employed and desktop you know they make up a huge chunk xero is still here four percent as a standalone software um you know in this other 20 you're seeing the other 30 accounting softwares that exist they're all clumped in that 20 you go over to New Zealand and Australia obviously zero is the winner because it's founded out of New Zealand and nobody uses QuickBooks and interesting thing is so looking at the UK which is neutral on this you'll see that you know zero and QuickBooks are pretty even so maybe 29 versus 25 so it's something that's widely used and that's sort of the the point of this illustration let's get to it QuickBooks versus zero the three reasons I use zero over QuickBooks number one it's cheaper number two it has better Integrations and number three for what I need to do with rental real estate it's just as capable as QuickBooks all right let's talk pricing this is QuickBooks pricing for QuickBooks online and like I mentioned earlier for Real Estate we need to track our expenses per property per the IRS so we need some way to track per property uh with QuickBooks you do that through class tracking and unfortunately the only two plans that have class tracking are the plus and the advanced plan so we're stuck over here yes QuickBook does have a workaround some people use where they set up their properties or 10 as customers and track of that way uh it becomes a nightmare once you start diving into the reporting and as you get more properties so fortunately we're limited to the plus plan they have this 4250 pricing and this is a promo for three months after the three months it goes to the full price of 85 and this price is just going up and up as the years go up there are some promos you can get where it's like 30 off this for like a year that makes it like sixty dollars but like still eventually you're more or less going to be faced with the full 85 price going over to zero um again ignore these prices because these are their intro yeah three month intro so the real prices are thirteen dollars thirty seven dollars and seventy dollars again the magic that happens here is zero includes class slash category tracking in their first tier plan so for the Thirteen dollar plan you can get that category tracking to track your expenses per property and that is huge when you really look at some of these things some of the limitations here are about sending quotes and sending invoices and bills that isn't very relevant to rental real estate so yes your tenants pay you every month but you're not really you know if you have a smaller portfolio again you're not really invoicing people you're not really sending invoices to contractors they will invoice you which is different but you're generally speaking not sending invoices and you know if you don't have employees again you know this plan right here is allowing you to do everything that you need to do for rental real estate at 13 versus 85 no promotions nothing that that's huge Integrations that's another reason that I like xero better I mentioned this earlier but zero started online has only been online QuickBooks started as desktop then they went online now they maintain both of them so xero does have more Integrations across the board than zero but particularly for me when I'm using things like importing receipts and emailing receipts the zero platform just works better for me and the things that I need to do so that's one thing using both of them that I like zero better for is zero as capable as QuickBooks for rental real estate accounting the answer is yes I touched on this before but Double Entry accounting the ability to reconcile bank accounts make journal entries do a cruel accounting if you need to have a real chart of accounts make a balance sheet do profit the law statements separate those by class look at comparisons of one year versus another all the stuff for real accounting software should be able to do zero can do that so let's dive in and let's take a look and see what zero actually looks like on the inside when you first load up zero this is what the dashboard looks like it has your different uh accounts here if they need any attention it'll tell you here so let's dive in so this looks like I need to reconcile some items here this is what the reconciling page looks like the ones in green it's found matches for yeah let's go through this manually so this is what came over for my banking statement it tells you know what you spent so this is actually stessa because I was testing it out so let's go here and uh I'm gonna type stessa I've never had them in here so they don't come up so I have to hit new contact if I have used them like it was like Home Depot it would came up already um we'll go here this is a do and subscription and I could write a description if I wanted to here I could say testing out accounting software um alternately if you wanted to have some some notes maybe discussions with you and your CPA or you and your bookkeeper you could write stuff there so I'm gonna go ahead and hit OK to that one looking up here Home Depot so this is one where this the like much like QuickBooks once you do stuff over it sort of knows what you're doing so it has found out that this is Home Depot I've already classified it as Home Depot before I classified it as repairs and maintenance before so it pops that in there what I do need to add is a class again this is tracking it by property I know this one is attached to South Street so I could hit that and if I could write a note here if I wanted to but I'll go ahead and hit OK and you can create rules the software's smart to know what you did before and come up with things and again that's QuickBooks does that too but that's one of the things that you know real accounting software you wanted to do going into reporting I think that is the big reason that you want a good accounting software for to be able to see what your business is doing at any time compared to the last time you know if you're not looking at this I would argue that you're not running a business so let's go into the profit and loss statement we all need that for our taxes um so we'll click in here and do p l by class and this will allow me to look at whatever date range I want for um my profit and loss by class the classes are different properties up here this is the Aggregate and you can see what you got going on and this is what you would need to give to your content you can again one of the things that I like is you can compare this versus you know let's do year-to-date comparison so now this will look at this year so 2023 what's happening 2023 year to date versus what happened in the previous year year to date so again this is the type of stuff you expect any good software to be able to do and what's so important about doing being able to do this and keep up with it this is the chart of account section and it's a real chart of accounts some accounting offers again don't have a full real chart of accounts this is something that you expect in any software you can see your assets you can track depreciation see what reliabilities are post against them this ultimately helps you create a balance sheet and that again is required for any partnership when you file a tax return goes over assets and liabilities this one is not really up to date but here's an example of what what it could look like my CPA uses QuickBooks so can I use a different accounting software this was a big question I had when I first moved over to xero so I talked to my CPA I also talked to about a dozen other CPAs and this this is the consensus that I got from everybody one CPAs hate doing bookkeeping their goal is not to go in your books and mess with things and if they do they're going to charge you their rate what a CPA wants is to be able to generate the reports that they need to in order to plug those things into your taxes so if your accounting software cannot generate the reports that they need balance sheets if you're in a partnership you know profit and losses by class and certain other things if they if your accounting software cannot generate those reports they're not happy if your accounting software can generate those reports they're happy another cool thing about xero is the way it's set up it's very easy if you know how to use QuickBooks to move over to xero it's set up with the debits and credits and the chart of accounts and the tracking and you know it's very similar so if you are talking to your accountant they'll be able to navigate that space because of the similarity between the two xero has made it pretty easy to move from QuickBooks over to the zero platform you can Port your data over it'll pull over all your chart of accounts and your balances and stuff unfortunately I don't have example live I can show you about going from QuickBooks to xero but it's something that's free it's done through what other partners called jet convert you pretty much go on there download the right version of your backup file throw it in there wait a little bit of time and it will pop everything over does a pretty good job popping stuff over it needs a little bit of cleanup but it's a pretty easy process so that's it in closing zero allows you to do what QuickBooks can do at a fraction of the cost about 1 6 of the costs so I like running an efficient business and I love saving money and when I could save money and not sacrifice quality even better so that's why I'm using it as my accounting software and why I'd recommend at least checking it out and see if it fits you", "comments": "This really deserves more views than it has. Great explanation for which accounting software to use for rental real estate accounting. I would be interested to see a comparison on how they compare for running a single agent (or even team) real estate sales (realtor/broker) business.\n\nAdditionally, how do either of these compare if someone is self-employed and some of their business and personal expenses are co-mingled across different accounts? I would estimate that most people are not as well separated as they should be, and often they have business expenses in personal accounts and personal expenses in business accounts.\nGreat explanation video!"}, {"publishedAt": "2023-05-27T14:17:06Z", "channelId": "UCMBOaLAO9bMMQBdhWcPrPjg", "title": "Rental Property Accounting And Bookkeeping Tips Using Xero Accounting", "description": "Schedule Call - https://calendly.com/d/2b6-z22-ysk Welcome back to Meru Accounting.

so first off what is QuickBooks and what is xero so zero pronounced zero is spelled x-e-r-o zero is an accounting software for small businesses of course it is easy to use accounting software uh for your small business in terms of the features breaking down zero first of course they have the ability to connect your bank accounts so that you can sync your bank directly and your financials to the cloud you can have everything in one place such as your invoices your contacts and your accounting online uh you can collaborate in real time and you can invite your advisor your tax advisor or work together with your other associates as well so you can have up to unlimited users which is really really nice on xero you can also customize it by connecting with other apps or adjusting the customizable dashboard addition to that you can automate tasks like invoicing and Reporting as you can see here you can do your year-end taxes and just get a general Financial picture on your business again like I mentioned before or you can connect your bank accounts as well you can collaborate with unlimited amount of people whether it's an accountant bookkeeper employees no matter how many people you have you can add them which is really really nice you also have a bunch of other different software Integrations like third-party apps such as as you can see here stripe and then you can go through the xero app store and they really do have a ton of different app Integrations xero definitely has a lot of app Integrations well over a thousand uh different app Integrations available within xero and just taking a look here this is sort of what their little dashboard looks like pretty easy and simple to understand so that's generally a zero in a nutshell taking a look at QuickBooks we'll also be comparing some of the similars and differences here as well as their different pricing plans taking a look at QuickBooks of course there are accounting software you could do receipts income Bank transactions uh manage your bills expenses invoicing and payments really a lot of the same kind of things in general you can also add on payroll or time tracking of course payroll is an optional addition so where do they really differ some of the biggest places where they differ in terms of accounting software is that QuickBooks does limit the amount of users that you're able to have this is a really big thing a lot of people uh definitely is important if you need to have more than just one or or a few users as you can see here you can only just have one user on their Simple Start Plan of course this pricing is accurate as in the making of today's video uh be sure to check out the QuickBooks pricing page as well as Zero's pricing page to get the most up-to-date pricing depending on what special offers they may currently be offering of course all that is subject to change now the fact that you can have unlimited users with xero is definitely a nice benefit compared to QuickBooks where you're limited in terms of the amount of users if you want to have more than five users you have to go all the way up to Advanced which is quite expensive that's the most expensive plan if you want to have over five users without having to share a login so that's definitely one point on the Zero side of things in terms of users one other thing to consider as well with xero and QuickBooks is that well QuickBooks is a bit more expensive as well if you're just taking a look at the raw pricing of course depending on when you're looking at this you may see some limited time special pricing offers but in general xero does have a cheaper entry level with their early plan uh which is a little bit cheaper about really about half the price as the Simple Start Plan with QuickBooks online so that's something to consider if you're just looking at what is the cheapest option that you can go with well zero definitely is a little bit cheaper since they do have that early uh pricing plan available where do they differ as well another aspect is in terms of the amount of quotes and invoices that you can send so if you want to send quotes and invoices on the early plan with xero taking a look at Zero's pricing page here is that you are limited to 20 invoices with their early plan if you want unlimited invoices you do have to go to their growing plan which at that rate is a little bit more expensive than even The Simple Start Plan which has unlimited uh invoices that you can send unlimited invoices with the Simple Start so that's something to consider there in terms of how many invoices do you need to send in terms of adding payroll uh QuickBooks does have their own payroll plans that you can use they also have other third-party Integrations but they really do want obviously push you towards their own Payroll Services as a software whereas xero uh they do not have their own payroll but per se they have an optional add-on of payroll with gusto which is really nice that they have that direct integration with gusto because in my personal opinion and a lot of people's opinions Gusto is the best payroll software solution out there uh and xero does have a direct integration with gusto in order to use them as payroll as an optional add-on again they don't have their own payroll software but they do have that Gusto integration which a lot of people want to use Gusto anyway which is really nice whereas QuickBooks they do have their own payroll which is cool if you you want things just all kind of within the QuickBooks ecosystem uh but you know that's something to consider there in terms of the pricing of the payroll really about the same in terms of what you would expect to pay with gusto payroll versus um QuickBooks payroll in terms of adding that to your accounting software if you're interested in that I know a lot of you guys maybe you don't need that then it's optional again that's just an optional thing worth considering as well in terms of their Integrations and add-ons and comparing the two different softwares as you can see here again Gusto payroll plays nice with xero if you do need that in your accounting software in terms of adding on payroll as an optional add-on now in terms of other features that are worth considering the differences here uh is that you know in general zero is a bit easier to use in terms of the overall design and look and feel that zero is definitely a little bit simpler and lower of a learning curve compared to QuickBooks software QuickBooks definitely has a little bit more of a learning curve in terms terms of its ease of use it's not too difficult you get the swing of things you can start using it it's really not too difficult to use but at the end of the day Zero is definitely a little bit more basic and easier to use that depends on of course if you want things more basic maybe you want things a little bit more advanced with the advanced reporting that QuickBooks has available but if you're just looking for something easier to use then maybe zero could be a better bet for you just because their dashboard is a little bit more customizable a little bit more simpler again QuickBooks has added some more customizability to it which is nice but in general you know zero sort of wins in that department in terms of ease of use now again one other thing to consider as well again lots of things to consider between the two different softwares is that zero is a little bit less popular especially in the US compared to QuickBooks QuickBooks is a lot more popular of a software now where does the popularity really matter this matters really mostly if you're looking at hiring out bookkeeping or accounting services is that more bookkeepers and accountants are familiar with using QuickBooks at least here in the states in the US it may be a little bit different depending on what country you're located in but at least here in the states the QuickBooks is much more popular software solution so a lot more bookkeepers and accounts are familiar with it it's going to be a little bit easier uh to get them to use or to use just accounting or bookkeeping services and having them give them access to your books xero is gaining in popularity as well in terms of accountants and bookkeepers so it is gaining in popularity but it may be just a little bit less popular so it's a little bit maybe a little bit more difficult in terms of sharing your accounting uh with your accountant or sharing your books rather with your account so that's just a little other thing to consider it's not the end of the world it's just in terms of popularity and where that may make a difference for you in general you know ultimately if you need a lot more users and for much cheaper price in terms of having unlimited users definitely go with zero in terms of having more users in terms of other things that are worth considering is that if you need um just general uh bulk transaction reconciliations you do have to go to their growing plan with xero whereas that's sort of more included with the more base versions of QuickBooks uh so it is something else worth considering in terms of the pricing uh and plan features for QuickBooks is just you know in general with their software you get more with their base version of Simple Start and really Simple Start is the best for most people using QuickBooks uh online is that you you just get more with their base version uh versus sort of zero and their base version or even Zero's cheaper version but you know if you're looking for something cheaper then obviously xero definitely has a cheaper plan available uh compared to QuickBooks now the the technically the cheapest plan with QuickBooks is QuickBooks self-employed I'm not really talking too much about that in this video because that's really more aimed at Freelancers and and um solopreneurs or those who are sole Proprietors uh self-employed QuickBooks uh QuickBooks self-employed is really a completely separate software it's more aimed for Freelancers so hey maybe if your freelancer is worth checking that out all you have to do is go over to you know QuickBooks self-employed or and go to the freelancer business stage but most of you guys watching this are probably more a little bit above that maybe a little bit more advanced maybe you know want a more scalable solution so generally QuickBooks Online especially the Simple Start is best for most people uh getting started especially if you need a more end-to-end accounting software solution uh for your small business much more comparable to xero in general the QuickBooks Online software is so hopefully you found this comparison helpful in trying to decide between QuickBooks and xero for accounting software for your small business and really Zero versus QuickBooks you know ultimately it depends on what your specific needs are in your business again hopefully you found this

this because there's so much repetition. I recommend editing out 50% of this\nAgreed with Todd and Ravi. This video is close to useless\nXero starts off at $10 $25 $35 now and actually its more $$$ after 3 months of service\nQuickBooks is not easy at all! It has a very challenging learning curve! I absolutely hate it!\nWhy is so hard for these YouTube people just to get to the point...good grief.\nI was hoping you would be showing the actual programs not just their web pages\nI\u2019m trying to decide which software is best for our small business.  Our accountant uses Quickbooks, but I\u2019m leaning towards Xero. . Thanks for the video."}]
