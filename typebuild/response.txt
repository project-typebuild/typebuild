finished [Music] what is your name and what are you saying at Brown my name's Chris and I don't have a concentration yet I'm sudata I study math CS my name's Geneva bass and I'm studying applied math and I'm Izzy and I'm studying International and public affairs I'm Lizzy I am a first year masters of Public Health student studying epidemiology I'm Sydney and I'm also doing the same so my first question is what do you think is the biggest stereotype of brown potheads I actually never heard that yeah like on 420 if you come here to the main green the entire sky is filled with smoke whenever I told people I was going to Brown like my brother for example who's like oh you're going to the stoner School something that I have always heard is that brown is the most creative Ivy I've heard better stereotypes about Brown I've heard like the school is like one of the happiest Ivy Leagues or just like colleges it's a good environment I think to be stressed did you apply to any other schools was brown your dream School no no what you only applied to Brown and it was in your dream school yeah yeah I wanted to apply early round because I want just to secure the win my favorite let me so I applied early action to Harvard and got rejected I only applied to six colleges Cornell UPenn Yale Boston and then Berkeley's and yeah I ultimately chose here so I applied to 12 schools I applied to Johns Hopkins Columbia UPenn Vanderbilt Emory Tulane Texas UNC Chapel Hill Northwestern oh and Harvard that's impressive how do you feel about Harvard Harvard was the only school that rejected me so we have the best clubs what do you think I actually visited quite a few Yale my opinion reveal is really high it seems like they have a lot of money you want to play a quick game I have a ranking list of all the IVs that's where I saw this exact board on Tick Tock are you the guy from Tick Tock yeah I did it at Columbia this was her ranking I think this is based on how just up to you whatever you think is the best man like everyone has like their strong points and weak points Cornell's strong point is I mean they have like pretty like solid frats you know like brown doesn't have any friends okay oh yeah Dartmouth is like has like nice nature and everything like I like trees you're too positive you're too positive this year just because we don't just believe I don't know anything about it nothing's wrong with Dartmouth Dartmouth they're just kind of there like they're in the woods they're doing their own thing they're having their special things but their ski slope I I think they they deserve to stay there Richmond definitely goes higher I actually don't know much about Princeton I know their undergrad is fantastic I know their engineering is fantastic public health so we're strictly a public health perspective yeah Princeton at the bottom I no I think Princeton above pen that's mine no no no no no no I don't like Princeton people I bet two Princeton people on Saturday and they were so lovely Princeton they're super smart but I think they know it a little too much I've been to Yale too their architecture is nice but their name and Convention sucks and the clubs also suck their bus is called the yuttle I think that yells number two because they have some of the like people who actually enjoy learning where's Brown number one ground definitely goes lower what brown is number one clearly Columbia over Harvard because they rejected you put them forward I think it's good I think this is good all right awesome yeah sure this is fine I think that's what we're going I think that's what we're going with and brown is to be clear it's it's like it's up here comment below what you think when you think of ivy leaves you think that you have to study a lot how much do you study a week on average do you think I think a lot yeah I think a lot yeah what would you estimate hours I would say like maybe maybe 10 to 15 like two hours a day yeah it's not that much it's probably like two or three probably like three to four but when I say that I'm not holed up in a prison of a library yeah like five to ten depending on the week actually 15 if I have an essay I think like 40 hours really but he's stunning I'm not stem so that's the difference that's a good clarifier do you ever feel burnt out at Brown no burnt out I think they're definitely days that are hard to I personally haven't experienced it yet it's possible at any school I think it's a lot less probable around I did get burned out last semester but that's only because I took a CS course which was my mistake so okay do you feel like you procrastinate a lot I don't think we have the room too oh yeah there's so many deadlines back to back that if you wait you're behind what I do for myself is I set like arbitrary deadlines there's so many other wonderful things to be doing here so if I didn't have my arbitrary deadlines I think I would it's my next question how much do you sleep as a student here I sleep a lot my friends roast me for it how much on average I schedule like nine hours but then recently I've been sleeping like 10 or 11. wow I have a 9 A.M so I try to go to bed by one but if I have a lot of homework that day I'll maybe push back to two or even three when's your average bedtime uh 10 pm that's when my club's finished my sleep a lot so I sleep like seven to eight hours a day that's the same actually too I need like at least seven to function my sleep schedule tends to wildly oscillate I would say I try and optimize for around 7 hours what's a typical bedtime it depends 4 AM once or twice but not I've never pulled an all-nighter for school and I'm never planning on good it's not healthy don't do it I think my last question is what is your favorite part about Brown open curriculum is nice don't have to take classes you don't want to the people are nice the good thing about Brown is it felt very like friendly and like beginner friendly whereas if I go to a different school it might have been like super hard and like Cutthroat my favorite part about Brown I again is I think the community honestly similar like the people here even like in classes that are like smaller like you get to know the professors better like I've been so supportive of like going to different events on campus for me it's the people 100 I've met some of the most incredible individuals on the planet here people who are so different from me and so different from like my upbringing and where I'm from have given me perspective on the world that I never thought that I would have like me a hundred percent like Geneva oh I'm being spun I'm not going to say the people because I think that Izzy already said people and also I always found that to be a very frustrating answer since of course everyone thinks that they like the people they're surrounded by however I am kind of going to go on a line very similar and say that I really like the Curiosity that permeates brown I think that that's manifested through a lot of the classes like that's what brown optimizes for in students right they want kids who have that this was a great interview thank you so much like comment

bachelor's in public health and i wanted to give you all a campus tour before i leave i wanted to make this as comprehensive as possible but also choosing the campus buildings that were most important to me during my time here at brown so hopefully i can save you some money on a plane ticket in case you can't make it in person so come along with me on this campus [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the list art building you will commonly find a lot of visa concentrators and non-concentrators that like taking art classes from visa 100 which is our first introductory art course to other studio courses and photography and we also have rizzy right next door so once people get into art here sometimes they'll cross register and take classes at risd then right across from list art building we have the rock and we're gonna head over there right now [Music] here we're at the rock it's also formerly called the john d rockefeller library you'll find a lot of humanities books here sometimes people from the center for language studies will practice languages with people in the lobby of the rock this is a great library and a favorite for many brown students who don't study at the silai which i will show you later and before this library the only library on campus was the hay right now we're at the hay which is right next to the rock this is definitely by far my favorite library at brown so if you're a first year definitely check out this library it's beautiful and you'll definitely be motivated to study it's definitely a more traditional library that looks sort of academic high ceiling i believe this is also the oldest library brown and it's completely quiet inside so if you're looking for a no distraction zone definitely would recommend studying here it's a beautiful day it's rhode island here we are at the van wickle gates we walk through these gates twice during our time at brown first during convocation and then the second time during commencement when we graduate otherwise these gates stay closed all year round and follow me now to the quiet green this is the quiet green it's right next to the main green which we're gonna head to in a bit but the choir green is as it sounds very peaceful and quiet um sometimes on a sunny day you can find students studying here taking a nap what else is there to say about that oh there's one one these lampposts have outlets if you checked out my dorm tour from junior year we lived in slater it has beautiful arch windows and i would definitely recommend it if you get a chance during the housing lottery also on the font side of the main green we have hope which is another dorm that i believe is all women's housing for sophomores i would say that all the dorms on the main green are pretty high in demand because of their location this is university hall where all the academic deans are fellowship advising you can find all that help in university hall if you need a dean's note to have an extension on something that's where you would go [Music] this green is called the main green one major event that's held here every year normally is called spring weekend where we invite musical artists to come and perform previously we've had artists like amine and daniel caesar so that's kind of what you can expect on main green this is fonts but it's formerly known as steven roberts campus center everyone calls it fonts and you can find the student activities office here there's also a basement called the underground where you can hear live poetry jazz there's also a student-run coffee shop in the underground there's a pool table downstairs you can find people playing video games on the main floor there's a cafe called the blue room which has the famous blue room muffins my favorites are the double chocolate one and red velvet this is sales hall there are sometimes events here led by student groups like the taiwanese night market there's also the midnight organ concert on halloween which everyone really loves we gather and lie on the floor to listen to some spooky organ music this is solomon this is another lecture hall at brown i've had intro to neuroscience here there's also intro to econ a lot of really large lecture classes this is the medcap research building my friend michelle who's been in the vlogs actually did research here um a lot of like psychology slash neuroscience research is done in this building and now let's walk over to soldiers arch is caswell a i think sophomore dorm it's a great location for especially stem students because it's right next to the science quad which we're about to go to right now [Music] this is the infamous science library or the cylin this was sort of my north star when i first came to campus because when i was lost i would literally just walk towards this huge sort of ugly building but people do really love it each floor has a different decibel or noise level so as you go higher it tends to get quieter the 13th floor is known as the stacks which is michelle's favorite she's currently filming this the basement is where a lot of pre-med students like to go and study before midterms [Music] this is macmillan hall where a lot of my chemistry lectures and labs were i had general chemistry organic chemistry all in this building and if you're pre-med you definitely will become familiar with it behind me is the cit or the computer science building a lot of cs students will come here for ta hours and classes there's also something called the sun lab where students like to work on their projects the one time i actually went into the cit there's a really cool floor where there's trees inside and i think not a lot of students know about that if you're not see us so maybe check it out [Music] [Music] we're at barrison hawley this is the engineering building it was actually recently renovated a few years ago and this is the student designed sundial it is a mobius strip that is supposed to represent infinite possibility which is definitely in theme with the engineering center to the left of the engineering building is minden i live there in my sophomore year and this is barristan hawley this is grad center there's a spiral staircase that you go off to get your key from grad center um this is bomb proof or something really yeah like during the war they made it so that people could be safe oh my god is like really like a well-known family what was it martin oh yeah he's a former president okay so gregory quad is named after a former president of brown since there hasn't been any mingling with the first years we usually call this place new dorm a and b but they call it the greg don't call it the greg we'll know your first year so we're here at joe's formerly known as josiah's they serve salads here and also sort of paradoxically they also serve late night snacks like fries and mott sticks and a really popular order is the spicy whip you'll hear that ordered a lot but it's just a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese on top secret ask them to hide a lot stick underneath your back oh yeah we would always come here like late night um we'd ask for just one mot stick and he'd give us one mot stick per person so one for me one for michelle one for jenny and he'd hide it under a better price so i'll miss him a lot thank you for the fremont sticks so joe's is also flanked by the new dorm buildings and this is sort of where the upperclassmen usually live it's really rare for sophomores i think to be placed in these buildings new dorm usually has suite style living so you get singles and then a hallway that connects connects like three of those singles into a suite yeah so there's a common room and a sink usually in these suites and the floors i believe are all carpeted let's go riston quad is home to a lot of our greek housing but some people live here and are not affiliated with greek life there's just like some buildings that have singles [Music] this is the sharper factory or the ratty it's the largest dining hall a lot of first years like to come here because it's right next bikini it's buffet style so you can load up your plate for one meal swipe but i haven't been there since my freshman year [Music] this is weyland arch sometimes there are acapella groups that come here and sing we have a lot of acapella groups now walking over to keaney for reference the main green is right there and to get to kini you just walk down the street [Music] okay wow i haven't been here in so long so me and michelle feeling very nostalgic i used to as a first year walk all the way to that door and my dorm was in that corner we're in keaney quadrangle this is the archibald bronson building but i think all of the dorms here look pretty much the same you can check out my dorm tour for the interior look at keaney kinney houses about half of the first year class so about 800 people live here so there's a pretty decent chance that you'll be living in one of these dorms kind of odd for a tour but i wanted to film health services because it can be kind of confusing to find it's called andrew's house not to be confused with andrew's hall or dorm where students live and for reference keaney is right over there so it's just down the street for first years in case they need health services this is paige robinson hall there are classrooms there's a chandelier room on the top floor which is highly coveted for studying but most people just come to this building to grab their mail also counseling and psychological services or caps i think cups is on the fifth floor but and you're when you lose your id card and if you lose your id card that's also in this building okay across from where i was just at is 85 waterman street this is where the environmental science building is they have a greenhouse on the rooftop which is really amazing and you can get a guided tour the foil people and the environmental science building behind the sculpture is actually called circle dance by tom friedman and it was inspired by the matisse painting this is a view of the walk is the walkway towards north campus at this intersection we can see granoff and the new performing arts center which should be finished by the time that you're watching this one street down from where we were just at is thayer street which is the bustling area of campus where there are restaurants and i would recommend hang for thai food otherwise there are some really great restaurants in downtown providence and you can't really go wrong if you walk down thayer street eventually you'll get to the north side of campus around sydney frank which is the neuroscience building if you're interested in neuroscience i totally check out the carne brain institute you'll also find the biomed building which is home to a lot of labs research and some of your bio classes that you might take at brown we finally made it to north campus and this is the pembroke seal legend says that if you step on the pembroke seal you will become pregnant um but here i am stepping on it anyway this part of campus houses a lot of the first-year dorms including andrews metcalfe miller and emwell in particular andrews is referred to as hotel andrews because it is a really nice dorm i think each dorm has their own sink andrews also has their own dining hall and i personally think andrews has the best food they serve pokeballs fah curry and one of my favorite things to do with my friends was go to pasta night on thursdays at andrews here we have alumni hall to the right of andrews and a lot of performances occur here from orchestral concerts to impulse dance company performances to events like the lunar new year banquet that csa or chinese students association hosts there are also some classroom buildings on this side of campus including smitty b where i had some of my public health courses this is pembroke hall i honestly never really came here but it's a beautiful building this used to be home to the women's college before brown was co-ed so i'm currently at the nelson fitness center which is free for students to use also in this quad is the meehan and the pittitola auditoriums brown lecture series happens around here joe biden actually spoke here before he was elected as president so there's always cool events going on around here as well as athletic events and trainings this is a bonus shot of downtown providence by the providence river if you want more insight into what it's like to hang out and live around downtown providence check out my senior year vlogs where i lived in river house and was able to spend a lot more time exploring the area all right i hope all of you enjoyed this campus tour if you have any questions about my experience at brown or any of the buildings that you saw on this video feel free to leave a comment down below or check out my other vlogs at brown and i will see you in the next video bye

I'm from Italy so I won't be able to attend the ADOCH events but thanks to videos like yours I can get a nice snapshot of campus! ;)\nI literally love your videos so much!\nOMG!!! So excited to go here next year! Thanks for the tour :) Probably the best one I've found on Youtube\nThanks to the author of the channel for this fascinating video! It is interesting to see how people live in other countries! It is very important to know foreign languages on such trips. I would like to recommend to all travelers a practical guide to learning foreign languages by Yuriy Ivantsiv \" Polyglot Notes. Practical tips for learning foreign languages\". This book contains a lot of useful tips on how to learn a foreign language for tourists, students, entrepreneurs and anyone who needs a foreign language in life. There are a lot of good tips on how to solve problems with the language from beginner to advanced level of language learning. It turns out that the traveler only needs to know a few dialogues and you can easily travel around the world! You don't have to spend a lot of time to fully learn a foreign language, you just need to learn what you can use when you travel. I wish everyone exciting travels!\nThis may be a little random but I love Michelle\u2019s voice \ud83d\ude2d\nHey May!!

I'm a fresh PhD student and want to move in there. Can you drop your opinion about River House here please?\nI enjoyed watching the good video.

"video_id": "fDl1GNggcsU", "transcript": "good morning everybody happy F do so it's oh my gosh I literally sound terrible I can't tell if I have really bad allergies or if I'm getting sick might be a little combination of both I tried this for the first time last night so we're going to take it out and see how it worked I'm not super optimistic cuz I kind of got lazy and like stopped trying halfway through but I had just switched back to communal bathrooms this year and when I was walking in the bathroom I had this on my head and I just felt really embarrassed okay um this this is problematic I don't um I think you can tell which side I gave up on halfway through M this side actually looks like decent and then this looks terrible so you definitely get what you put in we're going to do a little I hate my voice I'm like getting irritated we're going to do a little skin care and then I'm going to just load up on medication to feel better it's the official first day of class for my junior year I can't believe I'm already a junior we have a pretty fun day ahead and I'm excited to bring you guys along this is my schedule for today for anyone that wants to know the scheduling app that I use is called todoist I actually learned about it through one of my teammates at Brown I'm obsessed with it what time is it even it's 7:21 I got up really early today cuz I wanted to give myself time to like gather my bearings and get ready I also went to bed super early last night cuz I wasn't feeling well um so that's fun I have this class it's called theory of Behavioral economics at 8:30 a.m. and it's kind of weird because normally Monday Wednesday Friday classes run like 50 minutes and Tuesday Thursday classes run an hour and 20 minutes but this class is only Monday Wednesday and it runs an hour and 20 minutes so it's going to run from 8:30 to 9:50 which is a little bit different from what I'm used to but we'll see I'm actually shopping that class cuz I'm not technically in it I couldn't get a seat just filled up too quickly so I'm hoping that somebody drops it in the next 2 weeks and I can snag a spot for all of you guys that don't know the first 2 weeks of classes is considered shopping period where you can add and drop whatever classes that you want to kind of decide like what courses you want to take there's another class from 10: to 10:50 called Game Theory I'm also not in that class that was just another class that I wanted to shop so I'm not sure if I'm going to actually go we'll see and then I have Investments at 1:00 p.m. that's actually a class that I'm registered for will'll definitely be taking that because I need to to fulfill one of my requirements for my major and then I'm planning on getting lunch with my friend Addie at 2:00 and then after that we have this student athlete kickoff on the athletic quad at 5:45 I'm really excited about that cuz normally we get free things from it so who doesn't like free things oh my gosh I feel so unwell I need medication I'm going to take a zertek because these are good for allergies this is just like my daily vitamins this is off a Vibe no way no way am I going to start my junior year sick this is how desperate I am I'm whipping out the emergency I don't even like like this stuff but I'm going to force myself to take it because I need to feel [Music] okay oh it tastes so bad it's burning e back to my little walking through my day segment at 6:45 p.m. I have an appointment with my athletic trainer to get my Baseline test done so basically in order to get get cleared for athletics here you need to have like a baseline test run by one of your athletic trainers to get cleared all they really do is just like test you make sure you don't have a concussion kind of check in and see where your current injuries are at or if you have any and just like basically make sure that you're okay to start training and then that should only be like 15 minutes because then we have women's soccer game at 7:00 which I want to go and watch I feel like there's like gunk in my chest it's okay we're going to drop it I'm going to actively switch my mindset right now it's going to be a good day it's going to be a good day we shall start off that good day by making my bed also I love him he's literally the best I sleep with him every night now and I'm obsessed go get yourself one from Target this is my bed all made in my lovely dinked up wall this is my FOC fit not very exciting not going to lie the problem with today is that it's going to be 90\u00b0 so it's kind of hard to addess Q when it's that hot the fit for today is going to be these little levi shorts this tank top from skims that I've yet to wear and then these Nike Air Force Ones super basic oh my gosh I seriously need to fix my hair this looks like booty I just got changed I really like this tank top but while my curling iron is heating up we're going to accessorize so I think I'm going to throw these two bracelets on cute and then look how cute this is I have all my jewelry arranged in here and I'm going to switch out this silver necklace for my gold opal necklace because I'm feeling like I need a lucky day this is the necklace I'm going to be swapping it out for I just feel like it matches what I'm wearing better and my earrings are gold so I kind of want to like match that okay good enough let's fix this okay it's getting a little better it's a little better I might try to fix it some more after but I want to do a little bit of makeup before I have to leave need to cover up this this is such a tragedy I don't know what happened my skin was doing so good all summer honestly I think I got stressed and so I got a pimple there and then I picked it because it's my favorite hobby okay happy F do I'm going to see if I can go get a breakfast sandwich from Blue Room which is like a cafe that we have because I'm not going to survive an hour and 20- minute class without food it's not that hot out right now thanks thankfully but it's going to be very [Music] [Music] soon Addy just gifted me a hi Che happy F dog happy F dog [Music] hi it's my lunch I'm to her lunch is gone let hey everyone I'm having air for lunch just kidding I ate earlier but the ratty chicken was really gross not gross but questionable Andrew's chicken is best yeah I don't know how to flip this say hi vlogging on a phone is like really awkward cuz I feel like I should look at the camera yeah but like I want to look at myself I'm like it's really it's a hard life we live [Music] well this is Lindsay Emily the little Freshies on our [Music] team [Music] we're walking to soccer woohoo support yes oh hello there I just got out of the shower I'm in my little like robe feeling like a grandma um I'm about ready for bed I'm like exhausted today was really good but I just it was a lot I just did a million different things saw a million different people and I just feel really tired oh my gosh also I'm like still trying to get used to the whole like communal bathroom thing because I like keep forgetting things like every time I go to the bathroom I forgot something like I went to sleep for the bathroom forgot my keys then I forgot my towel and then I forgot my face wash so I literally had to come back in here like three separate times to get something I went to the mail room today and I got some goodies that I'm going to be opening with you and also this is the quarter zip that they were giving us at the student athlete kickoff I really love it I love quarter Zips and these are just like really nice ones I don't have anyone in this color so very excited honestly a majority of my free time today I spent doing my reading for tomorrow so there's this one class that I have to take in order to fulfill my like entrepreneurship requirements and you need to do summer work for it like all these readings and be ready to be like cold called on on the first day of class and the professor has like every right to like cold call you and he basically gets to like hand select who gets to stay in his class and it's just like stressful because I need to take this class and I heard it's kind of a lot of work I definitely don't want to be taking it in season so that means I either have to take it this fall or next fall and I'm just like a little bit stressed but it's going to be okay I got some stuff from babe original I absolutely love their stuff I tried Grande lash doesn't work the same I got a 3-month supply of their babe brow and babe lash these are basically two serums that are supposed to help grow your eyelashes and your eyebrows and let me tell you they work wonders seriously like I actually kind of like have eyebrows now crazy concept and I also like my eyelashes grew so much the last time that I used this stuff so I had to restock oh love and then finally I got this like brow filler looks like this it's like a tinted brow cream I don't I don't fully know what it is you basically just like brush it into your brows and it makes your brows look more easy even and Fuller and like a little bit darker but in a very natural way so this is very similar to the like glossier boy brow gel you can tell that I have really used this stuff because barely tell it's glossier anymore that's pretty much it for me today I'm honestly so exhausted but I need to like review my readings one more time to make sure I'm ready because like all my classes are super early tomorrow I am shopping three more classes tomorrow all requirements for my major so I kind of like need to take all of them I guess the good thing is I realized that I do not want to take my 8:30 a.m. class so I like really dodged a bullet there because now I like don't have to wake up at 8:30 but I didn't like not want to take it just because it was at 8:30 obviously I just like didn't like the material it's an elective so I could technically choose between like 15 other classes so like why would I choose that one if I'm not interested in it and the final exam was also on December 21st and I have to go back to school December 29th because of gymnastics so I'm really like not trying to have just a week at home I'm trying to like optimize that time and also I did not like the weights of those exams like I think the way things were weighted was like the final exam was 45% of your grade like imagine taking an exam that affects your grade that much that's scary and there was only one midterm which is even scarier because like you really have to do good on those exams I think I'm going to take this class called introduction to Game Theory instead it's like another course that fulfills like the same exact requirement so like I'm trying to get something that I'm interested in and it's also not going to kill me that is pretty much it for me today I had so much fun hanging out with you guys I really hope can we all just like manifest in the comments that I am not getting sick hey guys so it's currently December 30th way after I filmed this video that you guys just watched I will say despite my delusion I was in fact getting sick and got really sick for a few days but thankfully I was able to shake that cold without antibiotics I got sick later in that semester for like a month and had to get antibiotics but it felt weird to me posting a video that was filmed so long ago without like kind of touching base with you guys first so this is officially the last pre-recorded video that I had for you guys everything else that you'll be seeing from here on out is filmed from this date on I really hope you guys enjoyed the video and really quickly before I close off this Vlog I just wanted to tell you guys about these earrings that I co-created with Anna Louisa so these little Huggy Hoops that I have in right now are earrings that I co-created with Anna Louisa over a year ago this project has been so much fun for me to work on they let me take full creative freedom and create a pair of earrings to sell to you guys and also just like bring to life and wear myself it's been so amazing being able to send them and gift them to my family and friends and watch them wear my creation let me just tell you I absolutely love these earrings I mean since I've gotten them I rarely take them out these are easily my daily earrings they're basically a gold Huggy hoop with a synthetic opal teardrop dangly and they look absolutely gorgeous on everyone I've had a handful of my family and friends try them out and wear them and without being forced to I see a lot of them wearing them from day to day they're just super classy super beautiful delicate and versatile I'm absolutely obsessed with these earrings obviously because they're mine but you guys can go and Shop them with a link in my description they're only going to be on sale for a little bit longer so grab them while you can they're a great last minute gift to any family or friends that you have in mind or even for yourself because you got to treat yourself every once in a while also complete side note I actually put the right products on my hair and had the time to like take care of my waves and they looked so good today I'm obsessed but anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video I love you all very very much I hope you had a great 2023 and I hope 2024 is even better bye
